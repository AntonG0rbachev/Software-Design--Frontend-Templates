# Software-Design--Frontend-Templates

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains necessary and quite simple frontend templates for easy and fast backend software development

> [!TIP]
> In addition to the project presented before you, there is another branch of a similar but ~~deprecated~~ project built on ~~`npm dependencies`~~ in this repository.

## How is it works?
Image if u start to develop backend software and u do not want to coding frontend side of your`s application
- First you need to clone this repo into your project as subdirectory
  > Your project as a root directory `->` let's call it `root`\
  > |-/root\
  > |--/some others direcories of your project\
  > |--/this repo
- At this moment you can use templates
