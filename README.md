# Software-Design--Frontend-Templates

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains necessary and quite simple frontend templates for easy and fast backend software development 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PLEASE PAY ATTENTION, this project contains two independent branches, each of which can be used as a separate project
> - [branch](#branch-with-npm) with `npm modules`
> - and [branch]() without `npm modules`

## How is it works?
Image if u start to develop backend software and u do not want to coding frontend side of your`s application
- First you need to clone this repo into your project as subdirectory
  > Your project as a root directory `->` let's call it `root`\
  > |-/root\
  > |--/some others direcories of your project\
  > |--/this repo
- At this moment you can use templates

## branch with `npm`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want it to work correct, you need to run `npm install` for installing `npm` dependencis

> [!TIP]
> Soon I will create a part of patterns without `npm` dependencies

### How to install?

If you want to install part of project with `npm dependencies` you might do `git clone` but clone needed branch:
```
git clone --branch=npm-branch/main https://github.com/AntonG0rbachev/Software-Design--Frontend-Templates.git
```
